learning GitHub basics

Hi!

I'm Gabriel. I'm taking my first steps to learn more about coding. These past 5 years have been difficult for me. After graduating from college I've just been bouncing from one menial job to the next, all the while hoping my degree would eventually count for something; No luck so far. I feel like I haven't been growing at all these past 5 years. I feel stuck. I feel worthless. I feel like a loser...

Hopefullly, coding is something I could be good at... Something I could be proud of.
